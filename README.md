# Dad Jokes
Randomly shows (not very funny) dad jokes from [this dad joke website](https://icanhazdadjoke.com) via JavaScript's Fetch API. 

First time I am using fetch to make an HTTP get request to a 3rd party API. I made sure to incorporate *await* and *async* instead of using *.then* just because it makes the code look way cleaner in my opinion.
